## 🧙‍♂️ Game Concept

### Wizard Quidditch Match

**Core Gameplay:**
- Player wizard competing against AI opponents in a Quidditch-style match
- Flying mechanics with broom physics
- Strategic positioning and ball control
- AI agents with varied difficulty levels

**Game Modes (Planned):**
- Single Match: Quick play against AI
- Career Mode: Progress through tournaments
- Training Mode: Practice mechanics and strategies
- Multiplayer: PvP matches (future consideration)

---

## 🛠️ Technical Features

### 1. AI Agent System
Developing intelligent wizard opponents with distinct behaviors:

**AI Capabilities:**
- Path navigation in 3D aerial space
- Ball interception prediction
- Strategic positioning based on game state
- Difficulty scaling (Beginner → Expert)

**Behavior Trees:**
- Offensive behaviors (ball pursuit, shooting)
- Defensive behaviors (blocking, positioning)
- Team coordination (planned for team modes)

### 2. Flying Mechanics
Custom flight system for wizard broom movement:

**Features:**
- Physics-based flight with momentum
- Speed boosts and aerial maneuvers
- Collision avoidance system
- Camera system optimized for aerial gameplay

### 3. Ball Physics & Interaction
Quidditch ball (Quaffle) system:

**Implementation:**
- Projectile physics with air resistance
- Pass/catch mechanics
- Ball possession detection
- Goal scoring triggers

### 4. Match Management
Game state handling and scoring:

**Systems:**
- Match timer and phase management
- Score tracking (goals, points)
- Win/lose conditions
- Match statistics (passes, intercepts, saves)

## 🤖 AI-Assisted Development: UnrealMCP Integration

**Unique Feature:** This project leverages my custom UnrealMCP plugin for AI-assisted development:

**UnrealMCP Capabilities:**
- AI-driven actor spawning directly in Unreal Editor
- Natural language commands for level design
- Automated testing and validation
- Rapid prototyping of gameplay mechanics

**Development Workflow Enhancement:**
```
Developer → Claude AI (via MCP) → Unreal Editor
   ↓                                      ↓
Commands like:                    Automated Actions:
"Spawn 3 AI wizards"          →  Creates AI agents
"Add goal posts"              →  Places match elements  
"Test flight mechanics"       →  Runs automated tests
```

**Impact on Development:**
- Faster iteration on gameplay mechanics
- Reduced manual asset placement time
- AI-assisted debugging and optimization
- Demonstrates cutting-edge game development workflows
